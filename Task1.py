Task1: Create an undirected ER graph with 100 nodes and p=0.2 using networkx, set 'seed=1'.
       Convert the created nx graph to PyG graph, and add self loops into the graph.
       Print out the results of number of nodes, number of edges, has self loops?, and is directed?.
       Take a screenshot of the output and include the screenshot in your report.

       Note: You only need to complete the missing code (indicated by ##TODO). DO NOT change other parts of the code.
